TO DO
===

Right Now
==
Timer
- in DetailVC, in ViewWillDisappear, save the elapsed time to Singleton
- in viewWillAppear, recall and factor in the saved time
- Set up NSNotifications for the amount of time b/w the total elapsed time and the deal(s)
    - when the app is reopened before the notification, remove the notification to avoid duplicates
    - do we need any actions along with the notification?  "Ignore" / "Claim"?"

General
==
- DONE /// Hook up Parse Framework
- Hook up Facebook API
- Hook up FourSquare API

LoginVC
==
- Currently, 'Log In' and 'Sign Up' btns call the same action. Update this so wrong passwords, misspelled emails, etc. are accounted for.
- Add Facebook login option / tie existing users to it or create new one
    - Change Facebook login to work through FB instead of Parse so we can more easily get profile pics, etc. Then just call the Parse methods when FB API runs.
- Make the "next" key on keyboard shift focus to password field
- Make "go" gey on keyboard log in / sign up when password field is selected
